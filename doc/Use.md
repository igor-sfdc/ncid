### <a name="use_des"></a> Description

> NCID's main job is to display the Caller ID on multiple devices, but 
  it has advanced features.

> NCID can send and receive one line messages.  It can also forward a message
  through a gateway.  Review the **Messages** section for more information.

> NCID can give the caller a new name, called an alias.  It can do the 
  same with the caller's number or the line of the received call.
  Review the **Alias** section for more information.

> NCID can automatically hang up on the caller if the number or name is 
  entered into its blacklist.
  Review the **Hangup** section for more information.

> NCID can execute a hangup extension as another way to determine if it
  should hangup on a call.
  Review the **Server Extensions** section for more information.

> NCID provides two command line tools for viewing the alias file and 
  the call log. Two tools are also provided to modify the alias file, 
  the blacklist file, the whitelist file, and the call log.
  Review the **Command Line Tools** section for more information.

> NCID provides a call log, /var/log/cidcall.log, for calls and messages.
  It is processed each month if the operating system uses logrotate for the
  system log files.
  Review the **Log Files** section for more information.
