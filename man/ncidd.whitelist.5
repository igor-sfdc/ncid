.SH NAME
.B ncidd.whitelist
- whitelist file for \fIncidd\fR hangup
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIncidd.whitelist\fR file contains the expressions to match against a
telephone call name or number.
.P
If the hangup option is set and if there is no match in the whitelist file,
a match in the blacklist file will cause \fIncidd\fR to automatically
terminate the call.
.PP
The \fIncidd.whitelist\fR file understands 4 types of lines:
.TP 14
.B blank line:
skip it
.TP
.B comment line:
skip it
.TP
.B entry line:
process it
.PP
Entry lines contain one or more expressions and an optional comment.
An expression is either a string of non-blank characters or everything
between double quotes.  Multiple expressions are separated by spaces.
A comment must be last.
.PP
Entry line comments are either normal comments or match name comments.
.PP
A normal comment begins with a '#' and must not be immediately followed
by an equals sign. Anything after the '#' is ignored.
.PP
A match comment begins with '#=' and is followed by a name to display for
the caller when the entry matches either the number or name of a call.
Do not use double quotes around the name.
.PP

.IP \(bu
A '^' at the beginning of an expression means it must match at the start of
a name or number.
.IP \(bu
A "^1?" at the beginning makes a leading 1 optional.
This is only useful for US/Canadian numbers.
.IP \(bu
If an expression is longer than the name or number field it will never match.
