The server, ncidd, is a TCP/IP Caller ID Daemon.  It either monitors a modem
or serial device for Caller ID, or obtains it from a CID gateway.  It sends
the CID information over the network to its clients.  The server can alias
the NUMBER, NAME, and LINE identifier received before it is sent to its 
clients.

The US telco always sends the CID between RING 1 and RING 2.  If ncidd does
not receive the CID by RING 2, ncidd can be configured to indicate a call
by sending RING as the number and "No Caller ID" as the name.  This
permits NCID to display a visual indication of a call along with the date
and time. This requires a modem that indicates RING.

The ncidd server also sends outgoing calls and hangup calls from a blacklist.
Outgoing calls require a gateway that handles outgoing calls.
Call Hangups require a modem to hangup the call.

Instructions to make and install the NCID source package are in the various
INSTALL files included and the web site.
